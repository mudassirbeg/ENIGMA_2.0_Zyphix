# ENIGMA 2.0 – Zyphix

An interactive Machine Learning Learning Sandbox built using React and Vite.

This platform allows students to visually experiment with core ML concepts such as:

- Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate Adjustment
- Iterations Control
- Model Training Behavior
- Overfitting Simulation

## Features

- Interactive sliders for learning rate and iterations
- Real-time visualization of model training
- Beginner-friendly interface
- No heavy ML setup required

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Purpose

To make machine learning concepts easier to understand through visual simulation instead of theory alone.
